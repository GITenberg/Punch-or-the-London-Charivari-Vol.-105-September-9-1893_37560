<h1>Punch, or the London Charivari</h1>

<h2>Volume 105, September 9th 1893</h2>

<h2>A BROWN STUDY IN AUTUMN TINTS.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Being a Fragment from a Matter-of-fact Romance.</i>)</h4>

<p>And he walked along the
deserted streets and could see no one. Here and there would be a pile of
stones and wooden blocks, telling of an impeded
thoroughfare, but the place itself was empty. There
were seemingly no inhabitants in this deserted city. They had vanished
into thin, or, rather, murky air.</p>

<p>Then he looked at what
appeared to be a playhouse.
The doors were closed, and
the bill-boards were pasted over with blue paper. Evidently the portals of
the theatre had not been
open for weeks, perchance for months.</p>

<p>And it was the same in
the parks. Only the leaves
moved, and then only when the wind agitated them.
There were a few sparrows in the trees, but they seemed to be ashamed of
themselves, and chirruped (so to speak) with bated breath. Oh it was indeed
a scene of desolation.</p>

<p>And the shops, too!
Many of them were closed,
and those which were open seemed to be tenantless. There were no customers;
no counter attendants.
Trade seemed to be as dead
as the proverbial door-nail.</p>

<p>And the hoardings too! Even they had suffered.
Old posters, manifestly out
of date, fluttered in tatters; it had been no
one's business to restore the rotting paper,
and it had gone the way of other grass. The
placards were worse than useless; they could not be deciphered.</p>

<p>And yet again he marched on. There were
exhibitions, and no one to see them; museums,
and no visitors to inspect them; and churches,
and no one to fill them. At length he came
upon a guardian of the public peace who was
lazily gazing into the sluggish river over the
parapet of an embankment.</p>

<p>"Good sir," said he, "can you tell me if
this dreadful, lonely, deserted place is the City of the Dead?"</p>

<p>"Go along with you!" cried the policeman,
good-humouredly; "it's only London in September!"</p>

<p>And then he felt that he had been deceived by appearances!</p>

other ships that were equally bound to capsize, when they were injured in
the same manner; the reason being that instead of the armed citadel being
the major part of the structure, and the unarmoured ends the minor portion,
we had chosen to make the unarmoured ends the major part, measuring more
than half the entire length of the ship. The ships likely to capsize in a

a month on the Continent. I put the words I consider inappropriately
applied in italics. Paris is <i>inexpensive</i>, Boulogne is <i>beautiful</i>,
Cologne is <i>inodorous</i>, German cookery is <i>good</i>, <span class="sc">'Arry</span> on
his travels is

<i>delightful</i>,
and the Continent is <i>like</i> home.</p>

<p class="indrl">I could extend the list indefinitely, but have written enough to
show how imperfect the English language really is to convey accurately
one's most ordinary ideas. I may add that when I have used

<h4>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h4>

<p class="ind"><span class="outdent"><span class="sc">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<i>A decorously-furnished Drawing-room,</i></span> <i>at Hornbeam
Lodge, Clapham, the residence of</i> <span class="sc">Theophilus Toovey</span>, Esq.
<i>It is Sunday evening.</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>, <i>an elderly Gentleman with
a high forehead, a rabbit mouth, and a long but somewhat wispy
beard, is discovered sitting alone with a suitable book, upon which
he is endeavouring to fix his thoughts, apparently without success.</i></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/112-700.png"><img src="images/112-275.png" width="275" height="490" alt="'How shall I ever tell Cornelia?'" /></a>
<p  class="center">"How shall I ever tell Cornelia?"</p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey (reading).</i> "With what a mixture of indescribable
emotions did I find myself actually standing upon the very
brink&mdash;&mdash;" (<i>To himself, as he puts the volume down</i>) It's no use,
I can't concentrate my mind on Palestine to-night, I can't forget
this horrible "Eldorado." Ever since I got that official warrant, or
demand, or whatever it was, yesterday, I've been haunted by the
name. It seems to meet me everywhere; even on the very hoardings!
Why, <i>why</i> didn't I invest Aunt <span class="sc">Eliza's</span> legacy in consols, as
<span class="sc">Cornelia</span> told me, instead of putting it into a gold-mine? I think
<span class="sc">Larkins</span> said it was a <i>gold</i>-mine. If only I had never met him
that
day last year&mdash;but he seemed to think he
was doing me such a favour in letting
me have some of his shares at all; he'd
been allotted more than he wanted, he
told me, and he was so confident the
Company was going to be a success that I&mdash;and
now, after hearing nothing all this
time, I'm suddenly called upon to pay a
hundred and seventy-five pounds, and
that's only for one half year, as far as
I can make out.... How can I draw a
cheque for all that without <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>
finding out? I never dared tell her, and
she overlooks all my accounts. Why did
I, who have never been a follower after
Mammon, fall so easily into that accursed
mine? I am no business man. All the
time I was a partner in that floorcloth
factory, I never interfered in the conduct
of it, beyond signing my name
occasionally&mdash;which was all they allowed
me to do&mdash;and they took the earliest
opportunity of buying me out. And yet
I must needs go and speculate with Aunt
<span class="sc">Eliza's</span> five hundred pounds, and&mdash;what
is worse&mdash;lose every penny, and more!
I, a Churchwarden, looked up to by every
member of an Evangelical congregation,
the head of a household like this!...
How shall I ever tell <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>? And
yet I must&mdash;I never had a secret from her
in my life. I shall know no peace till I
have confessed all. I <i>will</i> confess&mdash;this
very night&mdash;when we are alone. If I
could speak to <span class="sc">Charles</span> first, or to that
young Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>&mdash;they will both be
here to supper&mdash;and <span class="sc">Charles</span> is in a
Solicitor's office. But my nephew is too
young, and Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, though he <i>is</i>
a journalist, is wise and serious beyond
his years&mdash;and if, as <span class="sc">Cornelia</span> thinks, he
is beginning to feel a tenderness for
<span class="sc">Althea</span>, why, it might cause him to reconsider
his&mdash;&mdash; No, I can't tell anyone
but my wife. (<i>Sounds are heard in the
hall.</i>) There they are!&mdash;they are back
from Church&mdash;already! (<i>He catches up his book.</i>) I must try to be
calm. She must not notice anything at present!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T. (outside).</i> I've left my things downstairs, <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>; you
can take them up to my room. (<i>Entering.</i>) Well, Pa, I hope you
feel less poorly than you did, after your quiet evening at home?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (flurried).</i> Yes, my love, yes. I&mdash;I've had a peaceful
time with <i>Peregrinations in Palestine</i>. A&mdash;a most absorbing book, my love.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You would find it more absorbing, Pa, if you held it the
right way up. You've been asleep!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> No, indeed, I only wish I&mdash;that is&mdash;I may have dropped
off for a moment.</p>

<p><i>Charles (who has followed his Aunt).</i> You wouldn't have had
much chance of doing that if you'd been at Church, Uncle!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> No, indeed. Mr. <span class="sc">Powles</span> preached a most awakening
discourse, which I am glad to find <span class="sc">Charles</span> appreciated.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I meant the cushion in your pew, Uncle; you ought to
have it restuffed. It's like sitting on a bag of mixed biscuits!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> We do not go to Church to be <i>comfortable</i>,
<span class="sc">Charles</span>.
Pa, Mr. <span class="sc">Powles</span> alluded very powerfully, from the pulpit, to the
recent commercial disasters, and the sinfulness of speculation in
professing Christians. I wish you could have heard him.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (squirming).</i> A&mdash;a deprivation indeed, my love. But I was
better at home&mdash;better at home.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You will have other opportunities; he announces a course
of weekday addresses, at the Mission Rooms, on "The Thin End of
the Wedge of Achan." <span class="sc">Charles</span>, I gave you one of the circulars to
carry for me. Where is it?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> In my overcoat, I think, Aunt. Shall I go and get it?</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Not now; I haven't my spectacles by me. <span class="sc">Thea</span>, did you
tell <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> to pack your trunk the first thing to-morrow?</p>

<p><i>Althea.</i> Yes, Mamma; but there is plenty of time. <span class="sc">Cecilia</span> doesn't
expect me till the afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> So <span class="sc">Thea</span>'s going up to town for a few days' spree, eh,
Aunt <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T. (severely).</i> Your cousin is going on a visit to a married
schoolfellow, who is her senior by two or three years, and who, I
understand, was the most exemplary pupil Miss <span class="sc">Pruins</span> ever had. I
have no doubt Mrs. <span class="sc">Merridew</span> will take <span class="sc">Althea</span> to such
entertainments
as are fit and proper for her&mdash;picture-galleries, museums, concerts,
possibly a lecture&mdash;but I should not describe
that myself as a "spree."</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> No more should I, Aunt, not by any means.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I never met this Mrs. <span class="sc">Merridew</span>,
but I was favourably impressed by
the way she wrote. A very sensible letter.</p>

<p><i>Alth. (to herself).</i> Except the postscript.
But I didn't like to show Mamma that!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But you'll go to a theatre or
two, or a dance, or something, while
you're with her, won't you?</p>

<p class="ind1">[<span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>tries to signal to him to be silent</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span>, you forget where
you are. A daughter of ours set foot in a
playhouse! Surely you know your Uncle's
objection to anything in the nature of a
theatrical entertainment? Did he not
write and threaten to resign the Vice-Presidency
of the Lower Clapham Athenæum
at the mere hint of a performance
of scenes from some play by that dissolute
writer <span class="sc">Sheridan</span>&mdash;even without costumes
and scenery? His protest was most admirably
worded. I remember I drafted it myself.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (with some complacency).</i> Yes,
yes, I've always been extremely firm on
that subject, and also on the dangers of
dancing&mdash;indeed, I have almost succeeded
in putting an entire stop to the children
dancing to piano-organs in the streets of
this neighbourhood&mdash;a most reprehensible custom!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Yes, <span class="sc">Theophilius</span>, and you
might have stopped it long before you did,
if you had taken my suggestion earlier.
I hope I am not to infer, from your
manner, that you are yourself addicted
to these so-called pleasures, <span class="sc">Charles</span>?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Dancing in the street to a
piano-organ, Aunt? Never did such a thing in my life!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> That was not my meaning, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, as you very well
know. I hope you employ your evenings in improving your knowledge
of your profession. I should be sorry to think you frequented theatres.</p>

<p><i>Charles (demurely).</i> Theatres? rather not, Aunt, never go near
'em. (<i>To himself.</i>) Catch me going where I can't smoke! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
You see, when a fellow has lodgings in a nice cheerful street in
Bloomsbury, it isn't likely he'd want to turn out of an evening after
sticking hard at the office all day!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I am glad to hear you say so, <span class="sc">Charles</span>. It is quite a
mistake for a young man to think he cannot do without amusement.
Your Uncle never thought of amusing himself when he was young&mdash;or
our married life would not be what it is. And look at Mr.
<span class="sc">Curphew</span>, who is coming in to supper to-night, see how hard <i>he</i>
works&mdash;up to town every afternoon, and not back till long after
midnight.</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-top: -2em;">[<i>The bell rings.</i></p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Rather queer hours to work, Aunt. Are you sure he
doesn't go up just to read the paper?</p>

<p><i>Althea (with a slight flush).</i> He goes up to <i>write</i> it,
<span class="sc">Charles</span>.
Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> is on the press, and has taken rooms here for the air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
the Common. And&mdash;and he is
very clever, and works very
hard indeed; you can see that from his looks.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be (announcing).</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>.</p>

<p class="ind1">[<i>A tall slim young man enters,
with a pale, smooth-shaven
face, and rather melancholy eyes, which light up
as he greets</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> How do you do,
Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>? You are a
little late&mdash;but some services
last longer than others. Oh,
<span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>, now I think of it, just
bring me a paper you will find
in one of the pockets of Mr.
<span class="sc">Collimore's</span> overcoat; it's
hanging up in the hall&mdash;the
drab one with grey velvet on
the collar. (<span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> <i>goes</i>.)
It's a circular, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>,
which was given out in our
Church this evening, and may interest you to see.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be (returning).</i> If you
please, m'm, this is the only paper I could find.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T. (taking it from the
salver, without looking at it).</i>
Quite right, <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>&mdash;we shall
be ready for supper when I
ring. (<i>When</i> <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> <i>has
gone</i>.) I can't see anything
without my&mdash;&mdash;<span class="sc">Althea</span>, just
go and see if I have left my
spectacle-case in my room, my
dear. It's astonishing how
they're always getting mislaid,
and I'm so helpless without
them. (<span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>goes</i>.)
Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, perhaps you
will read this aloud for me; I want my husband to hear.</p>

<p><i>Curphew (suppressing a
slight start).</i> May I ask if they
distribute papers of this sort at your Church&mdash;and&mdash;and
why you think it is likely to
interest me in particular? (<i>To
himself.</i>) Wonder if this can be a trap!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T. (taking back the
document, and holding it close
to her nose).</i> Gracious goodness!
<i>this</i> isn't the&mdash;&mdash; <span class="sc">Charles</span>, perhaps you will explain how you
come to have a paper in your pocket covered with pictures of females
in shamelessly short skirts?</p>

<p><i>Charles (to himself).</i> In for a pie-jaw this time! What an owl
that girl is! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It's only a programme, Aunt; thing they
give you at a music-hall, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T. (in an awful voice).</i> Only a programme! Pa, tell this
unhappy boy your opinion of his conduct!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (rising magisterially).</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span>, am I to understand that
a nephew of mine allows himself to be seen in a disreputable resort such as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Oh come, Uncle, you can't know much about the Eldorado, if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (with a bound).</i> <i>The Eldorado.</i> How <i>dare</i> you bring
that
name up here, Sir? What do you mean by it?</p>

<p><i>Charles (surprised).</i> Why, you must have heard of it&mdash;it's one of
the leading music-halls.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (gasping).</i> A music-hall? the Eldorado! (<i>To himself.</i>)
If it should turn out to be&mdash;but no, my nerves are upset, it <i>can't</i>

yet&mdash;what <i>am</i> I to say to him?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>He falls back into his chair with a groan.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span>, if you can stand there and feel no shame when
you see how disturbed and disgusted even Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> looks, and

<h3>COPHETUA, L.C.C.</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Grant Allen</span> charges
London with being "a squalid
village." Sir <span class="sc">Lepel Griffin</span>
suggests that the "Postprandial Philosopher" must have
been dining badly. He&mdash;Sir
<span class="sc">Lepel</span>&mdash;contends that "Like
the beggar-maid in Mr. <span class="sc">Burne-Jones's</span> picture, London is a
beautiful woman, fair of face
and noble of form, and only
needs the transforming hand
of some future King <span class="sc">Cophetua</span>
to strip her of her sordid rags,
and clothe her in the lustrous
raiment which befits her."
This is what <span class="sc">'Arry</span> would call
"the straight Griffin"! By
all means make <span class="sc">Cophetua</span> Chairman of the London
County Council&mdash;as soon as
you find him! Sir <span class="sc">Lepel</span>, instead
of joining in the parrot-chorus of disparagement,
actually says, "The best hope of the regeneration of London is in the
County Council"!!! He thinks "it is a mistake" to distrust them,
and would hand over to them (says the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>) most of the
machinery and material of our municipal life. Quite so. And as
the Gryphon (which is much the same thing as Griffin) said to the
Mock Turtle (suggestive this of the Civic Corporation), in <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i>, <i>Punch</i> would say to Sir <span class="sc">Lepel</span> or his problematic
<span class="sc">Cophetua</span>, "Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!"</p>

<p>When <span class="sc">Alice</span> ventured to say she had never heard of "Uglification,"
the Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. "What!
Never heard of uglifying!" it exclaimed. "You know what to
beautify is, I suppose?"&mdash;"Yes," said <span class="sc">Alice</span>, doubtfully; "it
means&mdash;to&mdash;make&mdash;anything&mdash;prettier."&mdash;"Well, then," the <span class="sc">Gryphon</span>
(who must have been a Postprandial Philosopher, surely) went
on, "if you don't know what to uglify is, you <i>must</i> be a simpleton."</p>

<p>By the way, why should not Sir <span class="sc">Lepel</span> himself essay the <i>rôle</i> of
King <span class="sc">Cophetua</span>, L.C.C., and help to beautify the modern Babylonian
beggar-maid? He says that "the general administration of London
is infinitely mean and inefficient," adding that "vested interests are
chiefly to blame for the national disgrace." Very well. Let Sir
<span class="sc">Lepel</span> help to give those same Vested Interests "vun in the veskit,"
squelch the Jerry Builder, and arrest the march of "Uglification,"
and then&mdash;why then London will, as in duty bound, erect <i>his</i> statue
in place, and on the site of, that other, and very different "Griffin,"
which is the very incarnation of Uglification, and material embodiment
of B&oelig;otian Bumbledom!</p>

<p><i>Sov.</i> But this will be exceedingly arbitrary treatment.</p>

at any rate it will be better
than a bombardment of your capital.</p>

<p><i>Sov.</i> Have you any other demand to make?</p>

that in future all work must be
given to artisans of our nationality.</p>

army, and dispose of your fleet.</p>

<p><i>Sov.</i> Come, that's impossible!</p>

<p><i>Neg.</i> Not at all. It is a
course I would strongly recommend if you want to keep your
throne, and your subjects desire to preserve their lives.</p>

<p><i>Sov.</i> Can you suggest anything else?</p>

<p><i>Neg.</i> We never suggest. We
order. Well, yes, you will do
nothing without our approval,

<h2>AN OLD "ADELPHI TRIUMPH!"</h2>

<p>Passing through town from one country place to another. Sparse
attendance at club. Am regarded with surprise by the few members
present, all anxious to explain why it is they are not out of London.
"Autumn Session" splendid excuse for everybody generally. "Compelled
to stop in town, dear boy. Autumn Session, dash it!" "But
you're not in the House." "No," is the ready rejoinder, "if I
were I would 'pair' and fly to the moors. But business connected
with the House" (this given with that mysterious nod and wink
which together, or apart, are accounted as equally intelligible to a
blind horse), "business, my dear chap, detains me." Great chance
for the club bore to get an audience of one. The Ancient Mariner's
time is in the dead season, when he can stop the shootist <i>en route.</i>
I am wary, and avoid him. I will dine earlyish, and go to&mdash;let me
see, what hospitable house of theatrical entertainment is open?
The Adelphi. Here I can see <i>A Woman's Revenge</i>, as written by
<span class="sc">Henry Pettitt</span>. Quite so. Dine at 6.30, and see it all out, as I
hear the final scene, an Old Bailey Trial, realistic to the last degree,
is the great attraction. Clearly to understand the pleadings on
behalf of the prisoner at the Bar I must be conversant with the
details of the entire story. By 8.10 I am in my seat, regretting the
loss of ten minutes' worth of the plot. Regret soon ceases on finding
that I am among old friends acting a story more or less familiar to
every playgoer. The house is literally crowded in every part, and
this, too, on a far from cold night at the very end of August. Town
may be empty, but the Adelphi is full, and "The Heavenly Twins,"
the Messrs. <span class="sc">Gatti</span>, must be rejoicing greatly.</p>

<p>For a cool, calm, calculating villain, recommend me to Mr. <span class="sc">Charles
Cartwright</span>, the very best of gentlemanly scoundrels of modern
melodrama. He is admirable: but directly the honest, outspoken
Adelphi audience nose his villainy he has a bad time of it, as no
matter what he may say or do, no matter whether he speaks slowly
or quickly, runs off, saunters off, lounges in or hurries in, he is at
once met, and so to speak "countered," by a storm of fiercely indignant
hisses. Surely an actor whose <i>rôle</i> is sheer villainy of the
deepest dye must be able to command enormous terms, seeing what
a long training it must require to arrive at taking cursing for compliments!
An Adelphi audience personally hate and detest
the stage villain, but for all that, they couldn't do without
him, any more than can the melodramatic author or the Messrs. <span class="sc">Gatti</span>.</p>

<p>After <i>the</i> villain, who certainly holds the first place in popular
unpopularity, comes the Heroic Boy, <span class="sc">Charles Warner</span>, all
heartiness and simplicity, a very "bounding Achilles;" and
next to him, the suffering heroine who defends herself with a
revolver, who is finally charged with murder, and gallantly
defended by the Heroic Boy, who, attired in wig, gown, and
bands, appears in the last scene of all that ends this eventful
his'tory as Counsel for the Defence, pleading for his wife before
a full court, much less crowded than is the Old Bailey generally,
and apparently far loftier, and much better ventilated.
The case does not attract considerable public attention, as there
is only a sparse attendance of nobodies in the gallery. Throughout
the drama Mr. <span class="sc">Gardiner</span> and Miss <span class="sc">Fanny Brough</span> capitally
represent the comic interest, which is brightly written, and
"goes" uncommonly well.</p>

<p>The other scoundrel is only young in his villainy&mdash;a mere
amateur as compared with Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Cartwright</span>, and
were it not for the things he does and says, he might at any
moment be taken for a comedian neither light nor eccentric,
but a fairly all-round and superior sort of "<span class="sc">Charles</span> his
friend," whose lines fall in pleasant places as feeders. Poor
Junior Scoundrel! from the first he has no chance of appearing
either gay or light-hearted, as he is invariably at the mercy of
the Senior Rascal, and is finally shot by his own revolver which,
after being used against him on several occasions, for the poor
Junior Rascal never has a chance with it himself, falls into the
hands of aforementioned Senior Rascal, and so he goes to his
dramatic grave without having had one solitary opportunity
of making a light and airy speech, or doing anything to bring
down the house. He comes in for his share of the hissing, poor
fellow! as does also Miss <span class="sc">Alma Stanley</span>, in the costume of a
kind of Madame Mephistopheles&mdash;a female villain of the deepest
scarlet and black dye. She, too, is one of the trio only created
to be hooted at by an enthusiastically virtuous public. This
monster of female depravity, however, is not a bad sort, and
shows some signs of repentance&mdash;a repentance not too late,
though it is deferred till 10.50, when it just comes in time to
assist the plot and unite two loving hearts.</p>

<p>There is a clever child in the story; far and away the best
child I remember to have seen, since the child in <i>A Man's
Shadow</i> at the Haymarket, who also figured in a trial and
gave evidence against a father (or mother, I forget which).
There was another wise child who did much the same sort
of thing and got its own father convicted in <i>Proof</i>, also at
the Adelphi. As to the trial scene (which seems to lack <span class="sc">Sullivan's</span>
setting of <span class="sc">Gilbert's</span> words), it seemed to me that Mr.
<span class="sc">Warner</span> was counsel, witnesses, prosecutor, and defender, all in
one, and, even considering the peculiar circumstances of the case,
anyone, from a purely professional point of view, would be inclined
to blame the presiding judge, Mr. <span class="sc">Howard Russell</span>, for such an
exhibition of Job-like patience, and for his quite unexampled toleration
of an advocate's irregularities. However, his summing up was
a model of conciseness and brevity, as it took for granted the jury's
perfect knowledge of facts and law, and its delivery occupied just
about a couple of minutes. Had Mr. <span class="sc">Warner</span> been the judge, and
Mr. <span class="sc">Howard Russell</span> the counsel, the above-mentioned allotment
of time would, probably, have been reversed. The jury, an intelligent-looking
set of men, utterly belied their appearance by acquitting
the prisoner in face of the most damning circumstantial evidence.
But as it was close on ten minutes past eleven, and as the author had
provided no sensational incident to follow, and had given no Fifth
Act to finish with, the decision of the Jury was much applauded by
the crowded audience in the auditorium, which then began to clear
out, highly satisfied with the excellent bill of fare provided for them
by Messieurs <span class="sc">Gatti</span>, the worthy restaurateurs of the old Adelphi Drama.</p>

<div class="ind1">
<p class="center">(<i>Prepared for his use by the
Authorities at the Admiralty.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> Does not England
possess the best possible fleet?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly, and always has enjoyed that advantage.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But do not the iron-clads comprising this fleet
frequently turn turtle?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Assuredly. In fact, whenever they have the smallest opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And do not the guns with which the ships are
armed occasionally burst?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not only occasionally, but frequently.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And are not the commanders of the fleet sometimes guilty of errors of
judgment?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To be sure, and sometimes these errors of judgment
lead to absolute disaster.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And are not the ships considerably undermanned
and some of the companies of inferior material?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Quite so. In fact, when there is a special
strain&mdash;man&oelig;uvres on a
large scale, or for a kindred reason&mdash;crews have to be
obtained from here, there, and everywhere.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And is it not quite a question whether some
dozen of our first-rate men-of-war are practically valueless?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well, scarcely a
question, because it is all
but certain that they are practically valueless.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And isn't there bullying
in the <i>Britannia</i>, and a general laxity in the
training of young officers to take important commands?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, but this is a
matter of small importance,
as all naval officers are
merely machines, and have
no right to think or act on
their own responsibility.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And does not a commander-in-chief sometimes make a grave and obvious
mistake, and do not all his
subordinates, knowing the consequences, implicitly obey him?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Of course, for this is the rule of the service.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And is it not a fact
that the navy is in want of the appliances to repair ships that have suffered
damage abroad?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Assuredly.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And is not our officers'
acquaintance with the characteristics of the sea rather
indefinite and distinctly limited?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is bound to be with
defective charts and other
false guides to naval knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then may it be justly assumed that we cannot
count upon our ships, guns, and commanders?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why, certainly.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And yet you declare
that England possesses the best possible fleet?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I do, and the little
drawbacks I have admitted
have no force in qualifying the assertion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why have they not?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because all the drawbacks exist in the piping
times of peace, and consequently the British navy
will prove its superiority
in the more dangerous days of war.</p>

<h2>NEW KING COAL CORRECTED.</h2>

<p>In the sub-heading of <i>Mr. Punch's</i> Up-to-Date Nursery Rhyme,
"New King <span class="sc">Coal</span>" (August 19, p. 74), a very obvious error was
made in speaking of the colliers of Northumberland and Durham as
"on strike," when in fact they were only "considering the advisability"
of joining their Welsh "brothers" and Midland "mates"
in a collective stand against the coal-owners. Since then,
<i>Mr. Punch</i> is glad to know, they have "thought better of it," and
have <i>not</i> joined the strike&mdash;having, perhaps, given "thoughtful
consideration" to <i>Mr. Punch's</i> friendly conundrum. "The bearings"
of the New Nursery Rhyme "lie in its application," and are not
altered by the writer's slip of the pen, to which, however,

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday.</i>&mdash;In Committee of Supply at last;
Home-Rule Bill laid aside for day or two awaiting Third Reading.
Meanwhile trifle of ten millions to be voted for the Navy. Members
generally, taking into account the long grind of the Session, regard
opportunity as favourable for making little holiday. Benches
occupied chiefly with Admirals, Captains, Secretaries to the
Admiralty and ex-Secretaries, with the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the
Exchequer</span> and his predecessor thrown in; also <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span>,
silent through debate on Home-Rule Bill, has a few words to say.
Imposing demonstration on bench behind ex-Ministers. <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>
in corner seat representing Youth at the Prow; at the other end sits
Experience at the Helm, the part taken (not for this time only) by
<span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>. Midway sits the Blameless Blushing <span class="sc">Bartley</span>.
Always blameless. To-night blushing, since Mr. G., accidentally
as casual observers take it, with prophetic soul as one of his hearers
well knows, referred to him just now as "the honourable baronet."
Effect upon <span class="sc">Bartley</span> striking and wholesome. Did not once thereafter,
up till stroke of midnight, open his lips. Sat in pleased
meditation, brooding over the prospect of a censorious world,
some day in the near future, hailing him as B. B. K., a title assumed
by the Unhappy Nobleman who long ago languished from the public ken.</p>

<p>After midnight spell broken; <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, Bart., woke up,
vigorously and indiscriminately objecting to progress with any business
on paper. Meantime <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> and <span class="sc">Tommy</span> had made up for any
remissness on part of their esteemed colleague. <span class="sc">Tommy</span> arrived
early on the scene, deck-laden with cargo of Blue Books and Reports;
sufficient in weight and bulk to sink a less trim-built wherry. Piled them up on either side of him. "In laager," as <span class="sc">Ughtred
Shuttleworth</span> ruefully said, glancing across the table at his adversary.</p>

<p>"Have looked forward to this day with keen anticipation," said
<span class="sc">Tommy</span>. "Have dropped a word
in season occasionally in debate
on Home-Rule Bill, I admit. But
it's to Committee of Supply I have
looked forward for full opportunity
of serving my <span class="sc">Queen</span> and
country. Now here we are in
Supply, and here we rest for a week
or two. I feel like the Walrus."</p>

<p>"How's that?" I asked, fearing
for a moment that much talking
had made <span class="sc">Tommy</span> mad.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember? Haven't
you been <i>Through a Looking-Glass</i>?</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">

true, as boldly rumoured, that Duke of <span class="sc">Connaught</span> has been appointed
to chief command of Army at Aldershot? If so, on what grounds?
<span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span> with strategic brevity answered that
appointment had been made in accordance with principle of selection
of the fittest. House, moderately full at moment, received the
explanation with much less enthusiasm than might have been
expected. This encouraged gentlemen below gangway to persist in
divers enquiries designed to illustrate, and perchance establish,
C.-B.'s position. <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> joined in hunt; particularly
anxious to know what experience in real fighting the new
Commander had enjoyed? "He was in command of brigade in
Egyptian expedition," said C.-B., making an involuntary sword-pass
at <span class="sc">Alpheus</span>.</p>

<p>"Yes," persisted that matter-of-fact person; "but will the right

fighting the Duke of <span class="sc">Connaught</span> stood?"</p>

of State</span> declined to commit himself to reply. Later, in Committee,
<span class="sc">Alpheus</span> staggered Civil Lord of the Admiralty with enquiry as to
steam-launch built at Portsmouth dockyard for Duke of <span class="sc">Connaught</span>
"at the expense of the people." "What has become of that
launch?" <span class="sc">Alpheus</span> asked, fixing <span class="sc">Robertson</span> with gleaming eye,
as if he suspected he might have it concealed somewhere about his
person. <span class="sc">Robertson</span> tremblingly answered that he knew nothing
about it. <span class="sc">Alpheus</span> not by any means mollified; means to bring up
whole subject in Committee on Army Estimates.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Over four millions voted on Navy Estimates by
some twenty or thirty Members representing House of Commons.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. made fine speech to-day, moving Third
Reading of Home-Rule Bill. Benefited immensely by compression;
only an hour long; but full of meat and matter. Long grown
accustomed to these supreme efforts of Perennial Youth. A series
this Session which, in respect of eloquence, vitality, and force, will
stand comparison with any equal number delivered in what was
(erroneously it now turns out) regarded as his prime.</p>

<p>More interesting as an episode was the reappearance on the Parliamentary
stage of a <span class="sc">Disraeli</span>. <span class="sc">Coningsby</span> has sat in House for full
Session; wisely abstained from imprudence of young Member of to-day,
who takes the oath at four o'clock and catches the <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> eye at
ten.
Now, in these closing days of Session, on seventy-ninth day debate
Home-Rule Bill, <span class="sc">Coningsby</span> modestly thinks "the time has come
when they <i>shall</i> hear me."</p>

<p>House did so with pleasure. Only a small gathering. Mr. G.
absent, which was a pity. On the 7th of December, 1837, Mr. G.,
sitting on back bench on Conservative side, lifted up "a fine head of
jet-black hair, always carefully parted from the crown downward to
his brow," to listen to an earlier maiden speech delivered by an
elderly young man, "ringed and curled like an Assyrian bull," his
violet velvet waistcoat garlanded with gold chains. Across the
bridge of fifty-six years a marvellous memory might have recalled
this figure had the ex-Member for Newark to-day been in his place
to look across the House at the dapper young man, with quiet self-possessed
manner, who, having considered this Government Bill, had
come to the conclusion that it is "a measure born in deceit, nurtured
in concealment, swaddled in the gag, and thrust upon the country
without the sanction of the people." The old Disraelian ring about
that phrase. House sees again <span class="sc">D'Israeli</span> the Younger; only
Younger than ever. But that is a reproach <span class="sc">Coningsby</span> may outlive.</p>

<p class="center">Finished at Last!</p></div>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Third Reading of Home-Rule Bill moved.</p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>, 1.30 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Eighty-second day of debate on Home-Rule
Bill. After being "gagged" through all those days and nights of
ruthless talk, a House crowded on every Bench, filling galleries and
thronging Bar, opens wide its mouth and cheers announcement that
Third Reading been carried by 301 votes against 267. When House is
unanimous, its unanimity wonderful. Everybody agreed
to shout for joy&mdash;Ministerialists because majority was 34, Opposition because
it isn't 38.</p>

<p>"Thank you,
<span class="sc">Toby</span>," said Mr. G., when I congratulated him on the end of the long
job; "I expect we're all glad it's over. Excuse me, but I just want to
drop the Bill in the post for the Lords."</p>

<p>Crowd waiting outside Palace Yard caught sight of him as he
tripped along. A ringing cheer woke echoes of the stilly night;
Mr. G. escorted home in triumph to Downing Street.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the Member for <span class="sc">Sark</span>. "Now I wonder how
many of those who are now cheering Mr. G. helped fifteen years ago
to break his windows?"</p>

<p>The Member for Sark always thinks of cheerful things.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Home-Rule Bill read Third Time.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
